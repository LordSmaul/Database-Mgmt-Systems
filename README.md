# Database-Mgmt-Systems

This folder contains all the projects from my Database Management Systems class. Most of the class was learning about how to implement SQL on a MySQL server that we log into from our computer, but we were also taught some basic relational database at the beginning to help us understand what happens within the databases themselves.

**Here is a breakdown of each program and its purpose. All relevant in-depth documentation is included in each file.**

Program 1: Writing relational algebra queries on a database file using the RelaX Relational Algebra calculator. <br> > Link to RelaX calculator used is [here](https://dbis-uibk.github.io/relax/landing)</br> > We used the built-in Silberschatz UniversityDB database

Program 2: Writing SQL queries to use on a provided library database in MySQL.

Program 3: Writing a Java program to connect and modify a MySQL database. The program will ask the user their name and password and attempt to log into the database. When successful, the user can then do the following: 
 - Display all information about the departments or courses
 - Add a new course
 - Delete an existing course
 - Modifying the title and/or credits of a course.

Program 4: Designing a schema and SQL insert file for a DVD rental company.
